/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for PetLife application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for all data. Each user can only
 * access their own data and the data of their pets.  Data is organized in a hierarchical
 * structure under /users/{userId}.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles.
 * - /users/{userId}/pets/{petId}: Stores pet profiles owned by a specific user.
 * - /users/{userId}/pets/{petId}/mealPlans/{mealPlanId}: Stores meal plans for a specific pet.
 * - /users/{userId}/pets/{petId}/supplementRecommendations/{supplementRecommendationId}: Stores supplement recommendations for a specific pet.
 * - /users/{userId}/pets/{petId}/activityRecords/{activityRecordId}: Stores activity records for a specific pet.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed.
 * - All write operations require the user to be the owner of the document or its parent.
 * - The rules are designed to avoid `get()` calls for efficiency and to ensure atomicity.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  The data structure inherently denormalizes ownership by nesting pet-related data under the user's document.
