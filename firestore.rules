/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for PetLife application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for all data. Each user can only
 * access their own data and the data of their pets. No cross-user access is allowed.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All data is nested under /users/{userId}. Pets are stored as subcollections under users,
 * and meal plans, supplement recommendations, and activity records are stored as
 * subcollections under pets. This hierarchical structure ensures clear ownership and
 * avoids the need for complex queries in security rules.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only create, read, update, and delete their own user documents.
 * - Users can only create, read, update, and delete pets that belong to them.
 * - Users can only create, read, update, and delete meal plans, supplement recommendations,
 *   and activity records that belong to their pets.
 * - Listing of user documents is disallowed to prevent potential information leakage.
 * - The rules prioritize security and atomicity by avoiding `get()` calls. All authorization
 *   decisions are based on path-based ownership.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  N/A - Path-based ownership obviates the need for denormalization.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 *  N/A - Data is segregated by nesting under user and pet documents.
