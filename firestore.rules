/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for PetLife application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model.  Each user can only
 * access their own data, and data associated with their pets.  Subcollections
 * inherit the ownership of their parent documents. This approach ensures data
 * privacy and prevents unauthorized access.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The Firestore data is structured hierarchically:
 * /users/{userId} - User profile information.
 * /users/{userId}/pets/{petId} - Pet profiles owned by a user.
 * /users/{userId}/pets/{petId}/mealPlans/{mealPlanId} - Meal plans for a pet.
 * /users/{userId}/pets/{petId}/supplementRecommendations/{supplementRecommendationId} - Supplement recommendations for a pet.
 * /users/{userId}/pets/{petId}/activityRecords/{activityRecordId} - Activity records for a pet.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - All data is private and requires authentication to access.
 * - Users can only create, read, update, and delete their own user document.
 * - Users can only manage pets, meal plans, supplement recommendations, and
 *   activity records associated with their own user ID.
 * - List operations are restricted to the owner of the data.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The data structure itself enforces ownership through hierarchical paths.
 * Specifically, pet documents are stored under the user's document, and
 * meal plans, supplement recommendations, and activity records are stored
 * under the pet's document. This eliminates the need for complex queries or
 * `get()` calls in the security rules. The rules can simply check the path to
 * ensure that the user is the owner of the data.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * No structural segregation is necessary as all data is private and owned by
 * individual users.
